# 👋 Hi, I’m **Karen**. 

### I'm passionate about code and learning new things. I'm currently looking for a job, and I'm quite a catch 🎣, so be sure to snap me up quick!

- 👩‍🏫 → 👩‍💻 I'm making a career change from higher education to tech

- 📚 I’ve recently been learning front-end languages (HTML5, CSS, JavaScript) and frameworks like Bootstrap and React

- 🌱 I have experience in a few back-end languages: Java, SQL, and Python (the last is currently on my docket to learn better)

- ❌ → ✅ - I practice TDD and ensemble programming regularly with [Ladies of Code](https://github.com/LadiesOfCodeGroupSessions) 

- 🐓 + 🐕 I own chickens and a dog (and no, they don't get along with each other very well...😳)

- 😊 My pronouns are she/her/hers
